# libft
This is my library that was done while studying at Hive Helsinki and is still 
being updated. In Hive we are not able to use standard functions and libraries, 
except a very few: **write**, **read**, **open**, **close**, **free**, **malloc**, **exit** and functions in
<stdarg.h>
This is good practice in coding and helps to understand how these functions work from the inside
