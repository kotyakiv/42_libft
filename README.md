# libft
This is my library that was done during studying in Hive Helsinki and still 
is being updating. In Hive we are not able to use standart functions and libraries 
except very few ones: **write**, **read**, **open**, **close**, **free**, **malloc**, **exit** and functions in
<stdarg.h>
This is good practicing in coding and helps to understand how these functions work from the inside
